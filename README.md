# StockMarketAnalysisAndMachineLearningPrediction-
Abstract:

The project that we have done is about Analysis and prediction of the stock market. Our focus was to see how the Covid19 issue actually affected the different types of industries such as Technology, Airlines, and Healthcare. I personally was looking at airline industries and how the Coronavirus pandemic affecting the airline industry since there have been canceled flights all over the world. By performing various types of analysis and using machine learning to understand and learn more about the stock market and predict the value of any particular company in a few months or years of stocks. Once covid19 started and the whole world and businesses were losing tons of millions of dollars for this pandemic issue, we were interested in how those huge companies were losing shares and profit or if there are any particular industries who are getting benefited such as healthcare companies or it’s just every company that losing business and profits. By recovering three various types of stocks in each market, we will have the option to decide how well each stock will do while helping us increase a more clear picture of its stock action. We have decided to use the python programming language for performing analysis and machine learning. We have used powerful python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, etc for the analysis using various graphs and plots to determine the stock movement over the period of time. We have also used machine learning to predict the market or how the market will behave in the future to understand how those stocks will take place near. Is their stocks will crash more or it will get better, such questions have arrived during this project. We have collected data as a CSV file and used DataReader to directly connect with the server to fetch the data from there to do our analysis. If I think like a data analyst or data scientist my role is to find the value out of my data. Such as fetching the data from various sources and analyzing better for understanding how the business or company is performing over a period of time. Our primary goal was to be in applying data analysis techniques, doing statistical analysis, and building high-quality prediction systems integrated with our companies. It takes a lot of time to study data analysis and machine learning algorithms to truly understand the concepts of understanding the market how it’s working.

Goals:

The main goal of this project is to investigate investment opportunities while weighing the risks and benefits while making educated investment decisions. A detailed understanding of the risks and the opportunities on high return for each industry. By gaining all this information, this will be used to help make future decisions in making smart investments.

We want to be able to analyze specific stock markets such as Technology, Airlines, and Healthcare based on the effects of the coronavirus outbreak globally. By retrieving three different kinds of stocks in each market, we will be able to determine how well each stock will end up doing. By analyzing the stock market data with Python (Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.). We will also store the data via MySql which will also help us access the data through jupyter notebook and Pycharm Python IDE, which will also help to generate graphs analyze the behavior of the data.

We will also try to implement a sort of machine learning for time series into our program. Further research is needed in order to complete this step. We also want to be able to implement effective team strategies in order to fully understand processes similar to Scrum.
